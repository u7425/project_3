    <h4>Childhood &#x2d; Present</h4>

    <p>
      I taught myself how to play the piano and I play for hours weekly for the sheer fun of it. 
      I first learned through YouTube videos that display the keys being pressed for a variety of songs, quickly advancing my love for piano. 
      Although I do not read music notes, I manage to play my favorite music by looking at where I should position my hands, developing muscle memory over time. 
      I also enjoy drawing detailed animal faces in my spare time.
